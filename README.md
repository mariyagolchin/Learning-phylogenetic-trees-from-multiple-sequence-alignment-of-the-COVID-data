# Learning-phylogenetic-trees-from-multiple-sequence-alignment-of-the-COVID-data
The objective of this project is to investigate the evolutionary history of a virus strain by performing a phylogenetic analysis. To accomplish this, you will use the "MAFFT" and "RAxML-NG" tools to estimate the topology and parameters of the phylogenetic tree using the FASTA file data of Omicron, Delta, or Alpha strain genomes
